Numeric format translator
Implement logic that translates stringified integer value into numeric format.

Sample: “123345” -> 123345, “-123345” -> -123345, “+1” -> 1

Constraints:
empty string is not applicable
Length of the input string: 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2^32-1
String should contain positive and negative numeric values in stringified format from the range [0-9] and arithmetical operation signs [‘+’, ‘-’] before numeric value
Decimal values are not applicable in this task

Functional Description:
Application should utilize class NumberFormatter and method parseInt that has input param string and returns integer value.
It is not allowed to use built-in programming utilities or third-party libraries provided by a specific programming language for a string to integer conversion logic.

Testing Notes
An application should be completed before sending for acceptance and should contain all necessary dependencies or libraries for running it.
Unit test coverage should be enough for verification of all major cases and scenarios but at least 5 unit tests should be developed for acceptance.

Code-Style conventions
Application should contains code documentation, code should be clear, self-documented and follow Google Style Guides
